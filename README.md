Thermal stability modeling of dry cannabis

This calculator simulates the degradation profile of cannabinoids in dried cannabis samples stored in the dark. 
A network of consecutive pseudo first-order reactions is assumed and the values for the rate constants are obtained from the stability study at the NRC Canada involving dried cannabis reference material (2019-2020).
